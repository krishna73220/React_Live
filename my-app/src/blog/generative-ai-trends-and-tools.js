                    <strong>Generative AI</strong> is an artificial intelligence
                    technology that can produce various types of content, including
                    text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around
                    generative AI has been highly driven by the simplicity of new
                    user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and
                    videos in a matter of seconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what do you think, what actually matters? Work being done in
                    seconds or work being done in the most organic and suitable
                    according to your target audience? Well, the answer to this
                    question needs to be detailed as the digital world itself has
                    content artists who feel discouraged due to the invention of AI
                    tools and trends in today’s generation.
                  </p>
                  <h2>THE DEPLETION OF ORGANIC CREATIVITY</h2>
                  <p>
                    There are innumerable people with uncountable ideations and
                    creativity walking our planet in this generation of Artificial
                    Intelligence. Humans are born with talents, talents that need to
                    be enhanced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No, I am not saying they are all born for the creative world but
                    Yes, they are born with some or the other talents that are in
                    built because that is the beauty of being a human. Its just that
                    the talents they are born with needs to be flourished and to be
                    pushed in order to bring beauty in their imperfections. There
                    are people who actually work on their talents, explore the
                    unseen part of themselves and turn out to be the best version of
                    themselves which actually helps them in knowing themselves,
                    building self confidence, developing the brain power and what
                    not!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But good morning, to the world of Generative AI! where people
                    are getting highly dependant on the quick and professional
                    outlay of everything they are supposed to think of. Hard work
                    and memory utilization is being killed as AI is nothing but a
                    lavish dish decorated and served on your table! The youth of
                    today’s generation are actually the spoon feeding spoilt brats
                    by the AI because they literally depend on the technology for
                    everything.
                  </p>
                  <h3>AI, A BOON OR A BANE?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Staying out of the world of creativity and developing organics
                    in human, Generative AI is no doubt the most advanced
                    technological gift for the generation! Talking about it’s
                    benefits we do have various points to put it on front such as :
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Reduction in human error :</strong> It significantly
                      reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Zero risks :</strong> It can overcome many risks by
                      letting Generative AI tools and trends do them for us. Whether
                      it be defusing bombs, going to space, exploring the deepest
                      part of ocean or surviving any unfriendly atmosphere. AI tools
                      and trends have literally made life very easy for all of us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>
                        Hampering of personal life is not in their command, so there
                        is no tiredness or space of feeling fatigue :
                      </strong>{" "}
                      As human can only work and should only work at a certain
                      amount of time, AI makes it possible to be working endlessly
                      without a break.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Digital Assistance and New Inventions :</strong> Some
                      of the most technologically advanced companies engage with
                      users using digital assistants, which eliminates the need for
                      human personnel. Many website utilize digital assistants to
                      deliver user-requested content. Some chatbots are built in a
                      way that makes it difficult to tell whether we are conversing
                      with a human or chatbot. In practically every field, it is the
                      driving force behind numerous innovations that will aid humans
                      in resolving the majority of challenging issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Daily Applications :</strong> It is a master of every
                      applications being used around you. There are various
                      advantages of AI, if we start to talk about the technological
                      or digital world.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      The fear of omnipotent machines acting like humans isn’t
                      far-fetched. Elon Musk has repeatedly warned that AI will soon
                      become just as smart as humans, and that will be a scary
                      situation because humanity’s existence will be at stake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But all this has nothing to do with the creative world, the
                      world of creativity here is far away from how technology puts
                      it up to be. AI can never be a boon for creativity because it
                      makes everything technological. The people who could have used
                      their own will, energy, ideas and mind on any creative topic
                      now feels easy to go through the very approachable and
                      advanced tools and trends of Generative AI . They don’t have
                      energy to work and explore the amazing side of their creative
                      mind which brings out something beautiful, rather, they bring
                      out psychological excuses which ultimately convinces
                      themselves and others.
